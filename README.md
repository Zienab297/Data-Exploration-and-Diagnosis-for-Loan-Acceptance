# Data-Exploration-and-Diagnosis-for-Loan-Acceptance

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes a dataset related to personal loans, with the goal of building predictive models to understand customer behavior and potential loan acceptance. The notebook demonstrates the use of data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques.

## Features

### 1. **Data Loading and Inspection**
   - The dataset, `Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv`, is loaded using `pandas`.
   - Initial exploration includes viewing the first few rows, inspecting the dataset's structure, and checking for missing values.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summarizes key statistics and identifies trends or patterns in the data.
   - Visualizations (if present) provide insights into distributions and relationships between variables.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handles missing values and prepares the data for modeling.
   - Includes feature selection or engineering steps to optimize model performance.

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Implements machine learning algorithms using `scikit-learn`.
   - Evaluates models using metrics such as RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. Place the dataset file `Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv` in the project directory.

4. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible editor:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Personal Loan Exploration.ipynb"
   ```

5. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Perform exploratory analysis.
   - Build and evaluate predictive models.

## Example Code Snippets

### Load Dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv")
print(df.head())
```

### Train a Linear Regression Model
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

X = df.drop(columns=["Personal Loan"])
y = df["Personal Loan"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundation for analyzing personal loan data and building predictive models. It highlights data processing, machine learning techniques, and performance evaluation. Further enhancements can include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of advanced algorithms.
